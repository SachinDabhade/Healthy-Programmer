# Healthy-Programmer
## Description
This is the small code that I write for myself. I want myself a healthy programmer in future. But, as I sit to code, I forgot jump the timelimits and this may be dangerous for our eyes, brain and backbone. So, I decide to write a code that will remind me for drinking water, doing physical exercise and much more.
